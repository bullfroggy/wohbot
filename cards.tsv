They taught him how to steal and how to fight, but he did not gain control of his mutant powers until the rogue geneticist Mr. Sinister removed part of his brain.	2560	2530	28	M	Super Hero	94200	60	40	Wild Card	Relatively High	Significantly strengthen ATK of your Tactics.

One of his favorite ways to use this power is by throwing playing cards like shuriken, which explode on contact with the target. He's also personally charming to an almost hypnotic degree.	3072	3036	28	M	Super Hero	188400	70	200	Wild Card	Relatively High	Significantly strengthen ATK of your Tactics.

I didn't do it for the shield or the costume or any of that. I did it because I wanted to earn my place in this fight. The world was coming apart around me and I was damned if I was going to let it happen without doing something about it. I would have fought with any weapon they gave me, anywhere, any time, because I believed in what we were doing. You know what they can't put in the Super-soldier Serum? Willpower, that's what.	1824	1728	15	M	Super Hero	10000	40	30	First Avenger	Average	Notably raise ATK/DEF of self.	Notably	self	ATK/DEF	self	up
